# **App Name**: Pothole Snap

## Core Features:

- Image Capture: Capture images using the device's camera, displaying a live preview.
- Metadata Display: Display image metadata such as location and date/time
- Dimension Estimation: AI tool that estimates the dimensions (length, width, depth) of potholes from the captured image.
- Geolocation Tagging: Attach geographical location data to images when captured.
- Data Overlay: Display dimension data and location data on top of the captured images.
- Batch Capture Mode: Enable capturing multiple images in quick succession, potentially useful for different angles or conditions of the same pothole.
- Pothole Severity/Type Classification: AI could not only estimate dimensions but also classify the pothole's severity (e.g., minor, moderate, severe) or type (e.g., alligator cracking, raveled, spalled).
- Automated Pothole Detection: AI could automatically identify and highlight potholes within the live preview or captured image, reducing manual framing by the user.
- Material Estimation: AI could potentially estimate and suggest the type of road material (asphalt, concrete) around the pothole.
- Volume Estimation: Based on dimension estimates, the AI could provide an approximate volume of the pothole.
- Confirmation Screen: Provide user confirmation and sending options after displaying all data.
- Offline Mode with Sync: Allow users to capture and store data offline when no internet connection is available, and then sync once connectivity is restored.
- Tutorial/Onboarding: Guided tour for new users to understand the app's functionalities.
- API for Integration: Provide an API for seamless integration with existing road management systems, GIS platforms, or work order management software.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke trust and precision, drawing inspiration from surveying and engineering.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a desaturated tint of the primary blue, creating a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF8C00), analogous to blue yet contrasting in brightness and saturation, used for calls to action and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), providing a modern and objective feel, ensuring readability and clarity for displaying technical data.
- Use clear, geometric icons for navigation and actions, ensuring ease of use.
- A clean and organized layout with clear information hierarchy, allowing for quick understanding of pothole details.
